## Candover Valley Choir

>The choir is still going strong but the website was getting a little out of tune so is in the process of being updated.

We are a very friendly local choir, welcoming to people of all ages and abilities, and we perform at a variety of events including concerts, special services, and weddings and funerals upon request.

### Contact

You can still reach us by email at `info` at `candovervalleychoir.co.uk` for any enquiries about concerts, singing with us, bookings, etc. We also happily accept compliments!
